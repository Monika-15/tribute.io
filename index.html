        <h2>Early Life</h2>

        <p>Muniba Mazari was born on March 3, 1987, in Rahim Yar Khan, Pakistan. Her early life was filled with dreams of becoming an artist. Muniba went to the <span class="blue-text">Army Public School</span>, and later attended college in her native home town for a <span class="blue-text">BFA</span>.At the age of 18, before she could complete her studies, she was married. In 2007, she was involved in a crash, which left her paraplegic.</p>

     <section id="crash">
        <h2>Crash and Recovery</h2>
        <p>In 2007 Muniba and her husband were travelling from Quetta to Rahim Yar Khan. Their car was in a crash, in which she sustained several major injuries, including broken bones in her arm, rib-cage, shoulder blade, collarbone and spine. Her lungs and liver were also deeply cut. Moreover, her entire lower body was left paralysed. She was taken to a nearby hospital, which was ill-equipped to deal with such a severe case. She was then moved to a hospital in Rahim Yar Khan, and eventually, she was admitted to the <span class="blue-text">Aga Khan University Hospital</span>, Karachi. There she received three major and two minor surgeries, where the doctors had to put a lot of metal in her arm and backbone in order to fix her. For that reason, she got the nickname <i>“Iron Lady of Pakistan”</i>. </p>
        <p>After being told that she can never walk again and bear children, Muniba initially felt hopeless. However, she explained how she soon changed perspective on her situation. Holding a bachelor's in fine arts, Muniba turned to painting. One of the first things she did was to brighten up the white surroundings of her hospital room.</p>
        <p>Muniba confirmed that the best decision she made in her entire life was the painting she made in the hospital with a deformed hand, and how it added colors to her colorless life.</p>
        <p>After spending two and a half months in hospital, Muniba moved to <span class="blue-text">Islamabad</span> where she continued to be bedridden. She used the adversity she faced to explore her artistic nature. She believes that it was art what kept her alive during her journey of being bedridden for a total of two and a half years.</p>
        <p>Physiotherapy started, which helped her recover enough to use a wheelchair. After treatment for her injuries, Muniba moved to <span class="blue-text">Rawalpindi</span>. In 2011, four years after the crash, Muniba adopted her son, <span class="blue-text"><i>Nile</i></span></p>
